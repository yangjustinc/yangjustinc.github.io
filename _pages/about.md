I'm a Research Fellow in the [Division of Psychiatry](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychiatry/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Professor David Osborn](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychiatry/people/david-osborn). My research involves analysing electronic patient health records to explore outcomes in those accessing secondary mental health services in the London boroughs of Camden and Islington. I'm broadly interested in the epidemiological applications of administrative and routinely collected data with a particular interest in mental health. I've also been leading the linkage of complementary datasets to enable further research at [Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust]((https://www.candi.nhs.uk/)) as well as the application of machine learning techniques to annotate and study patterns in patient records.

My doctoral dissertation elucidated the social and economic epidemiology of substance use disorders and their treatment in the contexts of the 2008 global financial crisis and most recent opioid overdose crisis, supervised by [Professor Carol Brayne](https://www.iph.cam.ac.uk/carol-brayne/) and [Dr. Andres Roman-Urrestarazu](https://www.iph.cam.ac.uk/network/directory/dr-andres-roman-urrestarazu/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). Before starting my PhD, I worked in [Avalere Health](https://avalere.com/)'s Market Access and Reimbursement practice where I advised life sciences companies, charitable foundations, and patient advocacy groups on issues pertaining to coding, coverage, and payment for drugs, biologics, and medical devices. I completed my master's degree at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/) and my undergraduate studies at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/).
