I'm a Research Fellow in Epidemiology and Database Analysis at University College London. My research involves analysing electronic patient health records to explore outcomes in those accessing secondary mental health services in the London boroughs of Camden and Islington. I'm broadly interested in the epidemiological applications of administrative and routinely collected data with a particular interest in mental health. I've also begun to apply machine learning approaches to interpret and annotate these types of data.

My doctoral studies were supervised by Professor Carol Brayne and Dr. Andres Roman-Urrestarazu at the University of Cambridge. My dissertation elucidated the social and economic epidemiology of substance use disorders and their treatment in the contexts of the 2008 global financial crisis and most recent opioid overdose crisis. Previously, I was a senior associate with Avalere Health where I advised life sciences companies, charitable foundations, and patient advocacy groups on issues pertaining to coding, coverage, and payment for drugs, biologics, and medical devices.
