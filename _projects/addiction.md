During my doctoral studies, I helped establish the Addiction, Drug Policy, and Public Health Special Interest Group (SIG) under the auspices of the Cambridge Institute of Public Health with my doctoral supervisor, Dr. Andres Roman-Urrestarazu, a world-leading expert in novel psychoactive substances and public policy. As part of this work, I help foster an interdisciplinary atmosphere for the exchange of ideas and research pertaining to addiction, drug policy, and public health.
