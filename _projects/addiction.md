During my doctoral studies, I helped establish the [Addiction, Drug Policy, and Public Health Special Interest Group](https://www.iph.cam.ac.uk/network/special-interest-groups/substance-related-use-disorders-in-public-health-special-interest-group/) under the auspices of the Cambridge Institute of Public Health with my doctoral supervisor, Dr. Andres Roman-Urrestarazu. This group aims to convene researchers across the University of Cambridge who share an interest in issues of addiction and drug policy as they pertain to public health. Since founding the group, I have left the University of Cambridge but maintain connections with group members.
