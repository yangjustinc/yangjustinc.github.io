Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust (C&I) uses software that takes electronic clinical records and automatically feeds them into the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) Research Database to support population-based research in psychiatry and mental health within the Trust and its partner research organisation, University College London (UCL). De-identified data from clinical records, including both structured fields and unstructured clinical free-text.

As part of my work, I serve as the CRIS Research Database Manager, managing research access to and use of anonymised clinical data for epidemiological and service evaluation studies. I review research applications for technical feasibility, provide technical guidance on study design, and extract data on behalf of research users. I also conduct analyses on behalf of the Trust, from time to time.
